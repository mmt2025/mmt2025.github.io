We invite submissions to the 13th International Conference on Mobile Mapping Technology(2025), which will be held in China, on **June 20-22, 2025**. The International Symposium on Mobile Mapping Technology (MMT) is the premier event traditionally jointly organized by the ISPRS, FIG, and IAG. The symposium has been organized on a two-year basis since 1997, when The Ohio State University hosted the first International Conference on Mobile Mapping Systems.
